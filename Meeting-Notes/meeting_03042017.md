### Ideas 

#### Try to find interesting query cube candidates 

for instance:

$cube_{01}:$
$
\$x\;type\;Person, \$x\;\$y\;\$z
$

 * \$y is dimension attribute
 * how can we choose the dimension attribute?
 * imagine: 
 	* if the attribute is integer, may it's good ...
 	* if theres are "few distinct" value for the attribute, maybe it's interesting... (like year, countries...)

 * our job is to find which dimensions could be interesting, and propose the queries to the user based on the recommendation system (a set of queries based on priority should be maintained)
 * also, from user's perspective, the system should be capable to recommend queries based on user's feedback: 
 	* For instance, from the very beginning, the system may propose to the user a set of types (Paper, People ...). The user should firstly choose which types he/she is interested. If user choose 'People', for instance, all the query cube about Paper (and others) should not be taken into consideration in the following recommendations.
 	* Then, the system may propose group by country, by age, by profession...
 	* Then, the user choose which propositions are of his/her interests
 	* We may get deeper and deeper to help find interesting data insights in a RDF-DW
