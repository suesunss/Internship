# Meeting notes 

* Shu, Ioana
* 20-04-2017

## Main points

* Review of the summary (By Ioana) of the paper: SEEDB (Especially some points in terms of word utilization, article structure...)	
	* A good example of paper summary by UC-Berkeley (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~fox/summaries/database/)

* Some inspiring ideas

**A comparison between SEEDB and our project**

|Perpective|SEEDB|Our Project|
|---|---|---|
|Database|snowflake schema|RDF graph|
|Q: query|Used to specify a subset of the dataset that an analyst wants to explore<br>In this paper: SPJ queries over snowflake schema|1.Type queries e.g. **x rdf:type T** <br>2.Ressource having most frequent set of properties<sup>[1]</sup><br>3.Simply, all D|
|Reference data $D_{R}$|May be defined as the entire underlying dataset(D), the complement of $D_{Q}$ or data selected by any arbitrary query. Analyst can specify.|**If** class-hierarchy (For instance, Pub$\leftarrow$Thesis, Pub$\leftarrow$Journals, Pub$\leftarrow$ConferencePapers) and we work on sub-class (For instance, journals, $D_{T}$ is the set of journals) <br>**Then**  $D_{R}$ is the set of Pub <br>**Else** $D_{R}$ is resources having most frequent set of properties (maybe also 2nd most frequent...) **OR** simply $D_{R} = D_{Q}$|
|$a$| attributes on which we group-by|1. Many potential: **a.** only those present in all $D_{R}$ resources **b.** all the attributes<br>2. We may choose only $N$ attributes. But which N dimensions? So, we should decide which attributes are good dimensions (<br>For instance, <br>1) if the attribute has few number of distinct values<sup>[2]</sup>) <br>2) if it's an integer <br>3) if it's a string<br>)</br>Problem can thus be reduced to $M$ attributes, but we still have $2^M$ possibilites, so starting from only one attribute can a solution (if each time we group by only one "good dimension", we have $M$ possibilites)|
|$m$, $f$ |measure attributes, on which we apply aggregate function|Measure $m$: <br>1. Only those present in all $D_{R}$ resources <br>2. all <br>Aggregate function $f$:<br>1. If it's a $number$ $\rightarrow$ sum, avg, min, max ...<br>2. If it's a $String$ $\rightarrow$ COUNT|
|Deviation|Utility is defined via deviation.Visualizations showing different trends in the query dataset compared to a reference dataset (large deviation) are said to have a high utility|Deviation between (a,m,f) on $D_{T}$ and $D_{R}$<br>**If** no $D_{R}$ **Then** use <br> **skewness**(3rd moment) or **kurtosis** (4th moment) as measure for interestingness<sup>[3]</sup>|


**Remarks**
[1] In most of cases, resources having most frequent set of properties may only be a small set of total resources. Consequently, we may need some **support** here: **How can we make sure that we work on a "big" subset of D?** (Should we explicitly tell the users the percentage of total data that we are working on when it comes to a small subset of data? Or should we explictly tell the users the percentage of total data at any time?)
[2] The meaning of "few number of distinct values": image attribute $A$ has 1000 distinct values. DB1 has 1000 resources having $A$, DB2 has 1000000 resources having $A$. For DB2, $A$ is a good candidate. Consequently, the threshold of "few distinct" could be $\frac{|D_{R}|}{K}$ for some value of $K$.

* Problems 

**What a user can do/say?**

* choose $D_{R}$ from a set of options
* choose at any step between $P$ options

For instance, given a view (a,m,f) = {x type inProceeding group by year count(*)}
How to determine the next $P$ proposals?
