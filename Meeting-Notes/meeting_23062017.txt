Meeting Ioana/Yanlei/Shu

1.) About the plots, give some evidences to prove the correcteness of the results. (For instance, some resources of type book can have more than 1 attribute of 'year'? )


2.) There should have some materilized tables that we can used to get the information that the program calculated during the run.

For instance, the if we inferred that Volume is of type Integer. 

table: p = volume
==> s  |  o 
column o can be explicly set as Integer type

For the rest that doesn't fit, use another table s | o where o is of type *STRING* to store

make sure to not loss Integrity Constraint


3.) Measure Threshold Policy

If a candidate fact has a measure such that **more than a threshold h1 number of candidate facts** have at most one value for that measure, then do not count(measure) as the aggregation and count(*) instead. [soft/mostly unique constraint]

for the derived atribute num_of_** (of type int), it's good to do the avg() but not count(*)

4.) another aggregate pruning 

see Ioana's mail

--- 
let CF be a candidate fact e.g. book
some dimension D
let A1, A2 be attributes  of CF such that there is a soft functional
dependency from CF to A1 (most  CFs have 0 or 1 instance of A1)
and similarly a soft functional dependency from CF to A2.
e.g. A1=title, A2=publisher

when considering A1 as a measure, we already said  that COUNT(A1),
e.g. COUNT(title), is not an interesting aggregate and instead we
should have COUNT(*);

now you can see that the same will happen when considering A2 as a
measure, i.e. we will find that COUNT(A2) is not an interesting
aggregate and instead we take COUNT(*) -- the same *, the same CF, the
same dimension.

These two aggregates with CF, D, a measure (A1 resp A2) which we
basically ignore, and COUNT(*),  are  very close, but not identical:

the first will reflect the CFs having at least one A1 and the second
will reflect the CFs having at least one A2...

So it would be good to find a method so that
if such aggregates DIFFER VERY LITTLE (basically there is a strong
overlap between the CFs that have A1 and those that have A2)
we should only include one of them in the top-K, not include the
second, and thus leave a spot for another interesting aggregate!
