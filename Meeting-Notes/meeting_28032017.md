# Meeting notes 
#### Ioana Manolescu, Yanlei DIAO and Shu SHANG
#### 28th March 2017


### Ideas 
**Data exploration**

* Data: relational model (set of objects)
* User interest: conjunctive query over a set 

**Go futher ?**

* Data: Union(R, S, T) of objects
* User intrest may vary from 
	* Conjunctive query (CQ)
	* First-order query (FO)
	* FO with aggregation (like counting)
	* Recursive query

**Graph Data Exploration**

* Data: nodes, edges, paths, graph pattern
* User interest: 

for instance, x is of type Book, it has a title which is y and y contains “xml” (full text match)

**Two ways**

* analytics by using **summary** (general ways)
* analytics by using active learning way (user give feedback, a more personalized way)
* what else can we group by? (zheng propose ```group by moment``` for instance), what kind of aggregation can we do using analytical query? (recall the pad questions)

### Paper reading

> * RDF Analytics: Lenses over Semantic Graphs
> * AIDE: An Active Learning-based Approach for Interactive Data Exploration> * Active Learning Literature Survey
> * SEEDB: Efficient Data-Driven Visualization Recommendations to Support Visual Analytics
> * Interactive Data Exploration Using Semantic Windows



### Next
* reading the paper, get the basic ideas
* doing summary when reading the paper, for instance, what's the problem, what's the main challenge, solutions that the author proposed...
* propose my own ideas
* prepare for next meeting at 4th April
