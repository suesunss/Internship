Present: Shu, Ioana

- about the pseudocode

The domain reduction could be settled later. For now, concentrate on the skeleton of code. Also for the user focused query. 

For threshold of "few distinct values", take 1/1000 for example. But these thresholds can be parametered. 


- about dataset

The dataset can be downloaed from data.oak.saclay.inria.fr using LDAP username.

The datase is in n-triples(.nt) format, it can be loaded to a relational database using: copy name_database 'path/to/file'

Of course, we can create other tables to help the analytics of rdf data, like encoding, but usually starting with the n-triples file is a good choice.

To download dataset from remote oak server:  scp sshang@data.oak.saclay.inria.fr:/datanfs/roatis/datasets/dblp/dblp.rdf .
