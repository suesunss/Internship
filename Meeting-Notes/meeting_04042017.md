# Meeting notes
* Shu, Ioana, Yanlei
* 04/04/2017


## Main points 
1. Paper: RDF analytics: lenses over semantic graphs
2. What is analytical schema, analytical query and query answering? 
3. How to apply the traditional DW OLAP operations to the analytical framework proposed in the paper? 
4. The presentation: should pay attention to definitions of concepts, not only the examples. 


## Next

* Figure out how to integrate OLAP operations into a RDF-DW (especially the roll-up and drill-down operations)
* The algorithms of query recommendation (meeting with Ioana at 03-04-2017 has already come to some basic ideas)
